# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

There are lots of things that happens under the hood of our browser that we are totally unaware about.

From the DNS converting the domain name into the IP Address and then the broswer then pass it into the broswer for processing and then several communication is made to the TCP to pick what type of port would be used based on the request passed on to the broswer.

I have written an article about everythin here and you can check it out and tell me if you agree with it or learnt something new.
