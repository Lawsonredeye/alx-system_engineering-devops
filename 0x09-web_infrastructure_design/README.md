# Web Infrastructure

This is about how the web and our computer actually interacts with the web/ internet from our search bar to the destinated website of our choice.

There are several things that works behind the scene for us to be able to access the data of our choice from the internet/online.
They are;
1. DNS
2. HTTPS
3. SSL
4. Load balancer
5. Server
6. Web Server
7. Database
8. Firewall

Without all these, we wouldnt be able to access information online or be able to have any security when transmitting data.
These key things like firewalls, SSL, HTTPs protect our devices to some extent as well as the data being transmitted from the host to the reciever. 
They actually encrypt data between the client and the machine to prevent data interception when trying to perform a handshake.
The list above actually play a key role on what we do on the internet and thats why its important to have some understanding of how the internet works with these.
